LLM Hacking 1/10
A 10 Post Series for LLM Hackings!

What is LLM ?
Large Language Models (LLMs) are Transformer Models that produce text. Transformer Models are Machine Learning (ML) models where prior content influences the probabilities of future output. 

Few Terminologies: 
ML: Machine Learning 
BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers 
LLM: Large Language Model 
RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback

Types of Possible Attacks:
	Prompt Injection Attacks
	Data Poisoning
	Adversarial Inputs
	Leakage of Sensitive Information
	Misleading Outputs
	Phishing Content Generation
	Model Inversion
	Membership Inference
	Side-Channel Attacks
	Bias Exploitation
	Denial of Service (DoS)
	Overfitting Exploitation
	Model Hijacking
	Backdoor Attacks
	Model Replication or Stealing
	API Misuse
	Reinforcement of Harmful Content
	Cross-Model Transfer Attacks
